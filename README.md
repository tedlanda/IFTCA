__Introduction__

Upon opening the scene, you see a green copy of the Quran which you can open by clicking on it. It it lie all verses of the original messages revealed to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in the 7th century as well as an audio version in several languages. 

This is meant for people outside of Mecca, Saudi Arabia who cannot take a pilgrimage there due to various reasons. However, if they have a smartphone and a cardboard, they can view the inside of the mosque and take a virtual tour. The virtual pilgrimage will be something tech savvy Imams will preach in mosques as it promotes education of the Arabic language, community, and spirituality.
